# AngularSelector

Basically this is one component project with simple wrapper around it to show its API.

Angular 5 for most powerfull frontend framework of all times
Bootstrap 4 for better styling
rxjs for async data loading
ng2-dragula for drag and drop functionality

# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally, then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Project itself contains only angular cli automatically generated unit tests but still you can run them by
runing `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Plans

In current component version there is no custom styling API nor external data loading API.
Also there is drag&drop which only supports one item selection.

Those problems are not so complicated but mostly needs too much time of my full day work week :(
